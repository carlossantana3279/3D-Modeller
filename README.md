Description - 3D modeling software created with c++ and openGL. Type make to run the program and more instructions will appear in terminal. We implemented Texture mapping. (Note:Since glutSolid<Shape> does not provide texture coordinates we got the source code from glut (https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/).We used the same code to draw the shapes, but we modified the code to 
provide texture coordinates.)
