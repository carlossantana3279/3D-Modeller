Description - 3D modeling software created with c++ using openGL and freeGlut. In terminal, type "make" to run the program and more instructions will appear in terminal. 


The 3D Modeling System allows selections of objects in the scene(via ray picking) and allows the user to transform objects in the scene (ie rotate, translate, scale). The user can insert Spheres, torus's, teapots, and tetrahedrons. You are also able to apply materials and textures to each object. You are also able to move the 2 light sources if you wish. As a side note:
We implemented Texture mapping as our extra feature. (Note:Since glutSolidShape does not provide texture coordinates we got the source code from glut (https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/). We used the same code to draw the shapes, but we modified the code to provide texture coordinates.)
