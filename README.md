Description - 3D modeling software created with c++ using openGL and freeGlut. In terminal, type "make" to run the program and more instructions will appear in terminal. We implemented Texture mapping as our extra feature. (Note:Since glutSolidShape does not provide texture coordinates we got the source code from glut (https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/). We used the same code to draw the shapes, but we modified the code to provide texture coordinates.)
